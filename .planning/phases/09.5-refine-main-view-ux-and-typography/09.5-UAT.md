## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Sidebar Layout
expected: Sidebar spans full viewport height from top. Three zones: logo/brand at top, scrollable feed list in middle, settings icon (with dot badge) + theme toggle + collapse button pinned at bottom. No header bar.
result: issue
reported: "The button and text for the theme switcher is not aligned with the other icons and texts on the sidebar. All other items are pass."
severity: cosmetic

### 2. Sidebar Collapsed State
expected: Clicking the collapse button shrinks sidebar to icon-only width. RSS icon for logo, each feed shows a circle with the first letter of feed name, settings/theme/expand icons at bottom. Expanding restores full sidebar.
result: pass

### 3. Article Row Summary Preview
expected: Each article row shows a 1-2 line preview below the title. If the article has been scored, it shows score_reasoning with a sparkle icon prefix. Otherwise shows a text-only RSS summary. Text is truncated at 2 lines.
result: pass
note: "User suggests reordering row layout to Header > Metadata > Summary/reasoning"

### 4. Article Row Read/Unread Styling
expected: Unread articles have semibold title, subtle background tint, and a filled accent dot (clickable to toggle). Read articles have normal weight title, no background, and no dot at all (no empty space where dot would be). No opacity difference between read/unread.
result: pass

### 5. Article Row Context Menu
expected: Hovering over a read article reveals a three-dot menu icon on the far right. Clicking it shows a menu with "Mark unread", "Open original", and "Rescore" options. Mark unread toggles article back to unread state. Open original opens article URL in new tab.
result: issue
reported: "The context menu should be visible on hover on all articles. For unread articles, the 'Mark unread' option should say 'Mark read' instead"
severity: minor

### 6. Filter Dropdown
expected: Filter is a dropdown/select (not individual buttons) with options: Unread, All, Scoring, Blocked — each showing a count. Disabled options when count is 0. Selecting a filter updates the article list.
result: pass
note: "User notes: 'All' should be at bottom and not show total count. When 'All' is selected, the Unread count disappears from dropdown."

### 7. Feed Heading + Sticky Toolbar
expected: "Articles" heading shown at top when viewing All Articles, specific feed name when a feed is selected. Scrolling down causes the heading to scroll out and the controls bar becomes sticky at the top with the feed name shown inline (smaller text) alongside the filter and mark-all-read.
result: issue
reported: "The header does not stick. I want the Feed name to animate down to the smaller size/up to the larger one when I scroll."
severity: major

### 8. Mark All Read
expected: Mark-all-read icon (double checkmark) is always visible in the toolbar. For a specific feed: marks that feed's articles as read. For All Articles view: shows a confirmation dialog before marking all unread articles across all feeds as read.
result: issue
reported: "The cancel button on the confirmation dialogue should be next to the confirm button."
severity: cosmetic

### 9. Inline Reader
expected: Clicking an article replaces the article list with an inline reader view (not a drawer overlay). The sidebar remains visible. The reader fills the content area with a sticky header bar at the top.
result: issue
reported: "Clicking on an article should animate the inline reader view open like an accordion component. At the moment it simply takes over and fills the entire content area."
severity: minor

### 10. Reader Sticky Header
expected: Reader has a sticky header showing truncated article title on the left, and on the right: open-original icon, up/down navigation arrows (disabled when at first/last article), and close X button.
result: issue
reported: "Fail, the header is not sticky."
severity: major

### 11. Reader Keyboard Shortcuts
expected: With an article open: pressing Escape closes the reader (returns to list). Pressing J navigates to the next article. Pressing K navigates to the previous article. Shortcuts don't fire when typing in an input field.
result: pass

### 12. Reader Content + Typography
expected: Article content is rendered safely (no raw HTML visible). Images are responsive and lazy-loaded, links open in new tab. Content area max-width is ~800px. A "Read on [feed name]" link appears at the bottom of the content.
result: issue
reported: "Console error: 'In HTML, <a> cannot be a descendant of <a>'. ArticleContent wraps images in <a> links but some source HTML already has images inside <a> tags, creating invalid nested anchors."
severity: major

### 13. Scroll Position Restore
expected: Scroll partway down the article list, open an article (reader shows). Close the reader — the article list returns to the same scroll position you were at before opening.
result: pass

### 14. Mobile Layout
expected: At narrow viewport width, a hamburger icon appears in the content area. Tapping it opens the mobile sidebar drawer with logo heading, feed list, settings link, and theme toggle.
result: pass
