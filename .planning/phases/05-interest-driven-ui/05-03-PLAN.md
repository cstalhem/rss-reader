  <name>Task 1: Verify interest-driven UI with score badges and sort controls</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Present the verification checklist to the user. The interest-driven UI includes:
1. Backend: list_articles endpoint with sort_by and order query params, nulls_last handling for composite_score
2. Frontend: ScoreBadge component with color-coded badges, SortSelect dropdown with 4 sort options, useSortParams hook for URL state, updated useArticles with sort params in queryKey
  </action>
  <verify>
User runs through the verification checklist below and confirms all items pass.

**Prerequisites:**
- Start backend and frontend dev servers
- Ensure some articles have been scored (composite_score is not null)

**Score Badges (http://localhost:3210):**
1. Each scored article shows a color-coded badge:
   - High scores (>=15): prominent orange/accent solid badge
   - Medium scores (10-14): subtler accent subtle badge
   - Low scores (<10): gray subtle badge
2. Unscored articles show a dash (—)
3. Queued articles show a clock icon
4. Actively scoring articles show a spinner

**Default Sort:**
5. Article list loads sorted by highest score first by default
6. Unscored articles (null composite_score) appear at the bottom of the list

**Sort Dropdown:**
7. Sort dropdown visible in the toolbar (right side, next to article count)
8. Select "Newest First" — articles re-sort by publication date (newest first)
9. Select "Highest Score" — articles return to score sort
10. Select "Oldest First" — oldest articles appear first
11. Select "Lowest Score" — lowest-scored articles first, unscored still at end

**URL State:**
12. URL updates when sort changes (e.g. `?sort=published_at&order=desc`)
13. Browser back button restores previous sort selection
14. Refreshing the page preserves the current sort

**Filter Interaction:**
15. Toggle between "Unread" and "All" — sort selection persists
16. Article count text updates correctly

**Empty State:**
17. If sorting by score with no scored articles, an explanatory message appears
  </verify>
  <done>User types "approved" confirming all verification items pass, or describes specific issues to fix.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

User confirms the interest-driven UI meets all three phase success criteria:
1. Score indicator visible on each article card
2. Articles sorted by interest score with high-interest first
3. User can re-sort by different criteria

<success_criteria>
User types "approved" confirming the interest-driven UI works correctly.
