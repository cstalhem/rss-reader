<objective>
Human verification of the complete interest-driven UI.

Purpose: Confirm that the visual presentation, sorting, and filtering work correctly in the live application. Visual design elements (badge prominence, accent tint subtlety, filter tab layout) require human eyes.

Output: Verified phase or list of issues to fix.

  <name>Task 1: Verify interest-driven UI</name>
  <action>
Present the complete interest-driven UI to the user for verification. All implementation was completed in Plans 01 and 02. This task only requires user inspection.

What was built:
- Score badges on article rows (color-coded by tier: accent for >=15, neutral for >=8, muted for lower)
- Sort dropdown with 4 options (Highest score, Lowest score, Newest first, Oldest first)
- Extended filter bar (Unread | All | Scoring | Blocked tabs with counts)
- Accent tint on high-scored rows
- Score display in article reader
- Blocked article filtering (hidden from main views)
- localStorage sort persistence
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Start the app (`docker-compose up` or dev servers)
2. Open the article list — verify articles are sorted by score (highest first) by default
3. Check score badges on article rows:
   - High scores (>=15) should show accent/orange badge
   - Medium scores (>=8) should show neutral/gray badge
   - Low scores (<8) should show muted badge
   - Hover over a badge to see tooltip with exact score
4. Check high-scored rows (>=15) have a very subtle orange background tint
5. Open the sort dropdown (near filter tabs):
   - Select "Newest first" — articles should reorder by date
   - Select "Highest score" — articles should reorder by score
   - Refresh the page — sort selection should persist
6. Check the filter bar tabs:
   - "Unread (N)" and "All (N)" should work as before
   - "Scoring (N)" tab should show articles awaiting scoring (if any). If none, tab should be disabled.
   - "Blocked (N)" tab should show blocked-category articles (if any). If none, tab should be disabled.
7. Verify blocked articles do NOT appear in Unread or All views
8. Click an article to open the reader panel:
   - Verify score is displayed in the header area
   - Verify existing features still work (category tags, quality score, reasoning text)
9. Switch between feeds in the sidebar — verify sort preference persists globally

All visual elements confirmed by user. No regressions in existing functionality.

<success_criteria>
User approves the interest-driven UI. Phase 5 requirements BRWS-05 and LLM-04 are satisfied:
- BRWS-05: User can see an interest score indicator on each article card
- LLM-04: Articles are sorted/prioritized by interest score in the article list
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-interest-driven-ui/05-03-SUMMARY.md`
