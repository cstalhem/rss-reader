# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 09.2-01
    provides: Settings layout restructuring with server components
  - phase: 09.2-02
    provides: CategoryRowShell extraction and component cleanup
provides:
  - ScoreBadge without Tooltip wrapper (~100 DOM nodes saved with 50 articles)
  - Semantic HTML elements on ArticleRow, ArticleList, Sidebar, and settings sections
affects: [future-accessibility-audits, dom-inspection]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "aria-label on Badge replaces Tooltip when visible text already conveys the information"
    - "Chakra as prop for zero-cost semantic element swaps (no styling impact)"

key-files:

    - frontend/src/components/article/ScoreBadge.tsx

    - frontend/src/components/settings/CategoriesSection.tsx
    - frontend/src/components/settings/FeedsSection.tsx
    - frontend/src/components/settings/InterestsSection.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "ScoreBadge uses aria-label instead of Tooltip -- score text is already visible so Tooltip was redundant information adding 2 DOM nodes per article row"
  - "Sidebar already used as=aside from a prior phase -- no change needed"
  - "ArticleList section wrapper added only to the populated list Box, not the loading skeleton or empty state -- avoids unnecessary landmark on placeholder UI"

patterns-established:
  - "aria-label on Badge: when badge text already conveys the value, aria-label provides screen reader context without Tooltip DOM cost"
  - "Chakra as prop semantic swaps: as=article, as=section, as=aside are zero-cost element tag changes with no style impact"

# Phase 09.2 Plan 03: ScoreBadge Tooltip Removal and Semantic HTML Audit Summary

**ScoreBadge Tooltip removed (saves ~100 DOM nodes with 50 articles), semantic HTML elements applied to ArticleRow, ArticleList, Sidebar, and all three settings sections**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-20T21:23:29Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-20T21:25:30Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments
- Removed Tooltip wrapper from ScoreBadge — the score text is already visible, Tooltip was adding ~2 redundant DOM nodes per scored article row
- Added aria-label to Badge for equivalent screen reader accessibility without the DOM overhead
- Applied as="article" to ArticleRow outer Flex for proper landmark semantics
- Applied as="section" with aria-label to ArticleList article rows container
- Applied as="section" with aria-label to CategoriesSection, FeedsSection, and InterestsSection wrappers
- Confirmed Sidebar already uses as="aside" — no change needed

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Replace ScoreBadge Tooltip with aria-label** - `0f35997` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Semantic HTML audit across frontend components** - `36a2183` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (docs commit follows)

## Files Created/Modified
- `frontend/src/components/article/ScoreBadge.tsx` - Removed Tooltip import and wrapper; Badge now has aria-label
- `frontend/src/components/article/ArticleRow.tsx` - Outer Flex uses as="article"
- `frontend/src/components/article/ArticleList.tsx` - Article rows container Box uses as="section" with aria-label
- `frontend/src/components/settings/CategoriesSection.tsx` - Outer Stack uses as="section" with aria-label="Categories"
- `frontend/src/components/settings/FeedsSection.tsx` - Outer Box uses as="section" with aria-label="Feed management"
- `frontend/src/components/settings/InterestsSection.tsx` - Outer Stack uses as="section" with aria-label="Interests"

## Decisions Made
- aria-label on Badge instead of Tooltip: the score value is the visible text AND the tooltip content — the tooltip provided zero additional information. aria-label is the right way to provide screen reader context for a non-interactive element without extra DOM nodes.
- Sidebar already semantic: `as="aside"` was present from prior work. Verified, no change made.
- Section wrapper placement in ArticleList: added `as="section"` only to the Box that renders populated articles, not the loading skeleton Box or empty-state Flex. A skeleton doesn't represent an article list section.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
- Pre-existing lint errors in unrelated files (AddFeedDialog, FeedRow, MoveToGroupDialog, useCategories, useCompletingArticles, useLocalStorage). These are out of scope per the deviation rules scope boundary — none are caused by this plan's changes.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 09.2 plans complete: Tooltip overhead eliminated, semantic HTML in place
- Pre-existing lint errors in the codebase are deferred technical debt worth addressing in a future cleanup pass
