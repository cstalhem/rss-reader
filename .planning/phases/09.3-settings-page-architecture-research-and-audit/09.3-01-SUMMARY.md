  - "Theme E expanded: shared SETTINGS_SECTIONS array in lib/constants.ts, Chakra Select with icons replacing NativeSelect, instead of just adding missing General item."
  - "Plan 01 groups Theme A + D (shared layout primitives + page header). Plan 03 groups Theme C + E (Ollama cleanup + nav overhaul)."

# Phase 09.3 Plan 01: Compile Findings Summary

**Settings architecture audit compiled into 5 recommendation themes with user-approved Phase 09.4 scope (11 success criteria, 3 plans)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~15 min
- **Tasks:** 2 (1 auto + 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Compiled research into user-reviewable 09.3-FINDINGS.md with 8 sections (hierarchy, hotspots, patterns, recommendations, dead code, open questions)
- Updated ROADMAP.md Phase 09.4 with concrete scope derived from findings
- User reviewed all 5 themes, expanded Theme D (SettingsPageHeader extraction) and Theme E (mobile nav overhaul with shared data source and Chakra Select)

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Compile findings document and update roadmap Phase 09.4** - `3397830` (docs)
2. **Task 2: User review checkpoint** - `58131ab` (docs: expanded Themes D+E from user feedback)

## Files Created/Modified
- `.planning/phases/09.3-.../09.3-FINDINGS.md` - Audit findings with 5 recommendation themes
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - Phase 09.4 scope (11 success criteria, 3 plans)
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Updated position and status

## Decisions Made
- Theme D: SettingsPageHeader as client component (CTAs need client state), page.tsx stays as server boundary
- Theme E: Shared nav array + Chakra Select with icons, replacing NativeSelect
- Plan groupings: A+D in Plan 01, B standalone in Plan 02, C+E in Plan 03

## Deviations from Plan
Themes D and E expanded in scope during user review. Original plan had D as a font-size fix and E as a one-line array addition. User feedback elevated both to proper component/system redesigns.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 09.4 has actionable scope with 11 success criteria and 3 plan placeholders
- Ready for `/gsd:plan-phase 09.4` to create detailed plans
