## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Weight button instant feedback
expected: In Settings > Categories, click a weight preset button on any category. The button should visually flip to the new selection instantly (same frame), not after a delay.
result: pass

### 2. Rename button visible on hover
expected: In Settings > Categories, hover over a category row (child or parent). A pencil (rename) icon should appear. Click it to rename the category.
result: pass

### 3. Delete button visible on hover
expected: In Settings > Categories, hover over a category row. A trash (delete) icon should appear alongside the pencil icon. Click it to delete the category.
result: pass

### 4. DnD ungroup child category
expected: Drag a child category from under a parent to the "Ungrouped" drop zone at the bottom. The category should move out of the parent and appear as a standalone ungrouped category.
result: issue
reported: "Fail. This does not work."
severity: major

### 5. Article reader weight change
expected: Open an article in the reader drawer. Click a weight preset on a category tag chip. The chip should update immediately to show the new weight. Only one network request should fire (no double mutation).
result: pass

### 6. Badge auto-dismiss on weight change
expected: If there are unseen categories (badge count showing), change a category's weight. The badge count should decrease. The badge X icon should be visible on hover over the chip.
result: pass
