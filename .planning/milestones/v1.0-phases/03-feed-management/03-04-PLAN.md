  <name>Task 1: Verify complete feed management flow</name>
  <action>
  Present the user with the verification checklist below. This is a human-verify checkpoint — no code changes needed. Wait for user confirmation.

  What was built:
  - Backend: Feed CRUD API (add, delete, update, reorder, list with unread counts)
  - Sidebar: Feed list with unread counts, collapse persistence, mobile drawer
  - Add Feed Dialog: URL validation, spinner, success with rename, add another
  - Feed Row: Drag-to-reorder, hover actions (desktop), swipe actions (mobile)
  - Delete: Confirmation dialog with article deletion warning
  - Inline Rename: Double-click to edit feed name
  - Mark All Read: Per-feed and from article list header
  - Article filtering: Click feed to filter, "All Articles" for aggregate view
  </action>
  <verify>
  Start both services: backend on :8912, frontend on :3210.

  **Desktop flow:**
  1. Open http://localhost:3210 — sidebar should show existing feeds (or empty state if fresh DB)
  2. Click '+' in sidebar — add feed dialog opens
  3. Enter an invalid URL (e.g., "not-a-url") — error shown inline
  4. Enter a valid RSS feed URL (e.g., https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index) — spinner, then success with article count and feed title
  5. Edit the feed name, click save — name updates
  6. Click "Add Another" — form resets
  7. Add a second feed (e.g., https://hnrss.org/frontpage)
  8. Click "Done" — dialog closes
  9. Both feeds appear in sidebar with unread counts
  10. Click a feed — article list filters to that feed only
  11. Click "All Articles" — shows all articles, aggregate unread count
  12. Hover over a feed — action buttons appear (remove, mark all read)
  13. Click mark-all-read — unread count drops to 0
  14. Drag a feed to reorder — new order sticks after page reload
  15. Double-click feed name — inline rename works
  16. Click remove on a feed — confirmation dialog with warning
  17. Confirm — feed and its articles disappear
  18. Collapse sidebar — reload page — still collapsed

  **Mobile flow (resize browser to narrow width):**
  19. Sidebar hidden, hamburger menu visible in header
  20. Click hamburger — drawer opens with feed list
  21. Click a feed — drawer closes, articles filter
  22. Swipe left on a feed row — action buttons appear
  23. Swipe right — buttons hide

  Expected: All 23 steps work correctly.

Phase 3 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:
1. User can add a new RSS feed by entering its URL and see articles from that feed appear
2. User can remove an existing feed subscription and see its articles disappear from the list
</verification>

<success_criteria>
User confirms all feed management features work correctly on both desktop and mobile. Phase 3 requirements FEED-01 and FEED-02 are satisfied.
</success_criteria>
