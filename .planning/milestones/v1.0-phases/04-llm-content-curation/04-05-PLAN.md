<objective>
Human verification of the complete LLM content curation feature: settings page, scoring pipeline, and article UI updates.

Purpose: Phase 4 introduces complex LLM integration and a new settings page. Visual and functional verification ensures everything works together before marking the phase complete.
Output: User confirmation that all Phase 4 features work correctly.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Verify complete LLM content curation system</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Present the verification checklist to the user. The complete LLM content curation system includes:
    1. Backend: Article scoring fields, UserPreferences model, preferences CRUD API, categories API, two-step LLM pipeline (categorization + interest scoring), scoring queue with APScheduler, Ollama Docker service
    2. Frontend: Settings page with prose preferences editor + topic weight manager, article rows with tag badges and scoring state indicators, reader drawer with prominent tags + score + reasoning + quick-block/boost from tag chips
  </action>
  <verify>
    User runs through the verification checklist below and confirms all items pass.

    **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure Ollama is running locally (or via Docker) with qwen2.5:7b and qwen2.5:14b models pulled
    - Start backend and frontend dev servers

    **Settings Page (http://localhost:3210/settings):**
    1. Click the gear icon in the header — should navigate to /settings
    2. Verify "Interests" textarea with placeholder text is visible
    3. Verify "Anti-interests" textarea with placeholder text is visible
    4. Type some interests (e.g., "software engineering, distributed systems")
    5. Type some anti-interests (e.g., "cryptocurrency speculation")
    6. Click Save — should show success feedback
    7. Refresh the page — preferences should persist
    8. Check the Topic Categories section — should show "Categories will appear here once articles are scored" if no articles scored yet

    **Scoring Pipeline:**
    9. Add a feed (or refresh existing feeds) to trigger scoring
    10. Check /api/scoring/status — should show articles queued/scoring
    11. Wait ~30-60 seconds for scoring to process
    12. Check /api/scoring/status again — should show articles as "scored"

    **Article List:**
    13. Browse article list — scored articles should show small category tag badges
    14. Check scoring state indicators: scored articles show score number, unscored show dash
    15. Verify tags don't break the layout or overflow

    **Article Reader:**
    16. Open a scored article in the reader drawer
    17. Verify category tags are shown prominently (larger than in list)
    18. Verify composite score and quality score are displayed
    19. Verify reasoning text is shown in italic
    20. Click a tag chip — should open weight popup with options
    21. Change a tag weight to "blocked" — should update immediately
    22. Go back to settings — verify the weight change persists in Topic Categories section

    **Re-scoring:**
    23. Change preferences on settings page and save
    24. Check /api/scoring/status — recent articles should be re-queued
    25. Wait for re-scoring to complete, verify scores updated
  </verify>
  <done>User types "approved" or describes issues to fix.</done>
