- [x] 01-02: Docker setup for local development
- [x] 01-03: Feed and Article data models
- [x] 01-04: Production Docker Compose configuration

### Phase 2: Article Reading UI
**Goal**: Web interface for reading articles with Next.js and Chakra UI v3
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Next.js app initialization

### Phase 4: LLM Content Curation
**Goal**: Ollama-powered article scoring with categorization and interest matching
**Plans**: 5 plans (3 core + 2 gap closure)

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Ollama integration and two-step scoring pipeline
- [x] 04-02: Category-based weighting system
- [x] 04-03: Settings UI for interests and topic weights
- [x] 04-04: Gap closure
- [x] 04-05: Gap closure

### Phase 5: Interest-Driven UI
**Goal**: Surface high-value articles through filtering and adaptive polling
**Plans**: 2 plans (plus 1 orphaned UAT plan without summary)

Plans:

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Chakra UI v3 for frontend (prop-based theming, good DX)
- Ollama for local LLM (privacy, no API costs)
- SQLite over Postgres (simple, sufficient for single-user)
- APScheduler over cron/Celery (in-app, Docker-friendly)
- TanStack Query for data layer (caching, background sync)
- Two-step LLM pipeline: categorize all, then score non-blocked
- Composite scoring: interest x category_weight x quality_multiplier (cap 20.0)
- Pydantic Settings config with lru_cache
- Production Docker Compose with Traefik reverse proxy

**Issues Deferred:**
- Ollama config only via YAML/env (deferred to v1.1 Phase 7)
- No user feedback mechanism (deferred to v1.1 Phase 10)
- No category grouping (deferred to v1.1 Phase 8)
- No feed auto-discovery (deferred to v1.2+)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Phase 5 UAT plan (05-03) created but never completed with summary
- No verification file for Phase 5
