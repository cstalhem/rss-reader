## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Goal | Verification | Score | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 Production Infrastructure | Docker deployment with persistence | 01-VERIFICATION.md | 4/4 truths | ✓ PASSED |
| 02 Article Reading UI | Browse and read with theme control | 02-VERIFICATION.md | 5/5 truths | ✓ PASSED |
| 03 Feed Management | Manage feed subscriptions via UI | 03-VERIFICATION.md | 24/24 truths | ✓ PASSED |

*Phase 5 note: Plan 05-03 was a human verification checkpoint that was completed (roadmap marks phase complete 2026-02-14). Evidence from 05-01/05-02 SUMMARY files confirms all features built and working. Integration checker verified all Phase 5 wiring.

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration checker result:** All clear

### API Route Coverage: 15/15 consumed

All API routes have matching frontend consumers:
- GET /health — Docker health checks
- GET /api/articles — useArticles hook
- GET /api/articles/{id} — ArticleReader
- PATCH /api/articles/{id} — useMarkAsRead
- POST /api/feeds — useAddFeed → AddFeedDialog
- GET /api/feeds — useFeeds → Sidebar
- DELETE /api/feeds/{id} — useDeleteFeed → DeleteFeedDialog
- PATCH /api/feeds/{id} — useUpdateFeed → FeedRow rename
- PATCH /api/feeds/reorder — useReorderFeeds → Sidebar DnD
- POST /api/feeds/{id}/mark-all-read — useMarkAllRead
- GET /api/preferences — usePreferences → Settings
- PUT /api/preferences — updatePreferences → Settings
- GET /api/categories — usePreferences → Settings
- PATCH /api/categories/{name}/weight — TagChip quick-block
- GET /api/scoring/status — useScoringStatus → tab counts

**Intentionally unexposed:** POST /api/feeds/refresh (admin/manual only)

### Phase-to-Phase Wiring: All verified

- Phase 1 → 2: Config system, WAL mode, CORS, article API ✓
- Phase 2 → 3: TanStack Query layer, AppShell, theme system ✓
- Phase 3 → 4: Feed CRUD, CASCADE delete, article feed_id filter ✓
- Phase 4 → 5: Scoring fields, preferences API, scoring status ✓

## E2E User Flows: 5/5 verified

| Flow | Status | Key Path |
|---|---|---|
| First-time setup (add feed → scoring → display) | ✓ Complete | AddFeedDialog → POST /api/feeds → enqueue → score → display |
| Daily reading (sort → read → auto-mark) | ✓ Complete | SortSelect → useArticles → ArticleReader → auto-mark 12s |
| Feed management (add → rename → reorder → delete) | ✓ Complete | AddFeedDialog → FeedRow inline edit → DnD → DeleteFeedDialog |
| Scoring feedback (view tags → block category) | ✓ Complete | ArticleReader → TagChip menu → PATCH weight → re-score → Blocked tab |
| Sort/filter navigation (change view → articles update) | ✓ Complete | SortSelect/tabs → useArticles params → backend filter → render |

## Tech Debt

Minor items, none blocking:

1. **Phase 5 missing VERIFICATION.md** — Human verification was done via plan 05-03 checkpoint, but no formal verifier agent report was generated. Evidence sufficient from summaries and integration check.

2. **Manual refresh not in UI** — POST /api/feeds/refresh exists but isn't exposed. Feeds auto-refresh every 30 minutes via scheduler. Could add a manual refresh button in v1.1 if desired.

## Anti-Patterns

All phases scanned clean:
- Phase 1: 0 issues
- Phase 2: 0 issues
- Phase 3: 0 issues (7 issues found during human verification, all fixed)
- Phase 4: 0 issues (6 issues found during human verification, all fixed)
- Phase 5: 0 issues (1 Chakra v3 Tooltip pattern auto-fixed during execution)

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.0 PASSED audit.**

All 18 requirements satisfied. All 5 phases verified (4 formal + 1 via summaries). Cross-phase integration verified with no gaps. All 5 E2E user flows complete end-to-end. No critical tech debt. Ready for milestone completion.
