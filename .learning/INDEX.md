# Project Learning Index

A living knowledge base of patterns, best practices, and lessons learned. Each file covers a specific topic with targeted, actionable content.

## How to Use

- **Agents**: Read relevant files before implementing. Check INDEX.md to find applicable topics.
- **Adding learnings**: Create a new atomic file for each distinct topic. Update INDEX.md with a one-line description.
- **Mistake log**: When an agent makes a mistake that required fixing, document it in the relevant topic file or create a new one.
